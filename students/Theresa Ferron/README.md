My Name is Theresa.  I'm a single mom of 4 amazing kids and ready for an amazing career!

### Why am I here?
After 12 years of being a well-paid domestic engineer, I found myself an unemployed single mom.  What a huge change!  So - I'm here because I want to independently provide for my children, in a way that allows me to explore my creativity.  I also like the idea of being able to bring my children's ideas to life.

###Where did I come from?
I've been in Seattle for almost 6 years.  My home town is San Diego, CA, but I've also lived in 
*Wisconsin 
*North Carolina 
*South Carolina 
*Amsterdam 
*Sardegna, Italy. 

###What do I do?
That's easy!  Kids, kids, kids, and *kids*!  I have also run a small sales business, had my own photography business, worked in call centers, and studied human services management, psychology, and child development.
